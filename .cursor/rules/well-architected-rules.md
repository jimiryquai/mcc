# Well-Architected Framework Implementation Rules

## Purpose
These rules provide practical guidelines for implementing the Power Platform Well-Architected Framework (WAF) in our projects. They serve as a checklist and reference for ensuring our solutions align with WAF principles.

## General Rules

### Documentation Requirements
1. Every solution MUST have:
   - Architecture decision records (ADRs)
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Environment strategy document
   - Security compliance checklist
   - Performance benchmarks

### Environment Strategy
1. MUST maintain at least three environments:
   - Development
   - Test/UAT
   - Production
2. SHOULD consider additional environments for:
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing
   - Training

## Pillar-Specific Rules

### 1. Reliability Rules

#### Error Handling
- MUST implement error handling for all critical operations
- MUST log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- MUST handle both system and business errors appropriately

#### Data Management
- MUST implement backup strategies for custom data
- MUST document data recovery procedures
- MUST test recovery procedures quarterly

#### Business Continuity
- MUST maintain documented failover procedures
- MUST conduct disaster recovery testing bi-annually
- MUST define and track RTO/RPO metrics

### 2. Security Rules

#### Access Control
- MUST follow least-privilege principle
- MUST document all custom security roles
- MUST review security roles quarterly
- MUST implement appropriate data loss prevention (DLP) policies

#### Data Protection
- MUST classify all data according to sensitivity
- MUST encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- MUST implement appropriate sharing policies
- MUST regularly review and audit data access

#### Compliance
- MUST maintain compliance documentation
- MUST conduct regular compliance reviews
- MUST track and address compliance gaps

### 3. Operational Excellence Rules

#### ALM Practices
- MUST use solution-aware source control
- MUST implement automated deployment pipelines
- MUST maintain deployment documentation
- MUST use development branches for features

#### Monitoring
- MUST implement application monitoring
- MUST set up alerting for critical metrics
- MUST maintain monitoring dashboards
- MUST review logs regularly

#### Change Management
- MUST document all changes
- MUST follow change approval process
- MUST maintain change log
- MUST communicate changes to stakeholders

### 4. Performance Efficiency Rules

#### Data Operations
- MUST optimize data models for performance
- MUST implement caching where appropriate
- MUST monitor query performance
- MUST implement pagination for large datasets

#### Resource Usage
- MUST monitor API usage
- MUST implement throttling strategies
- MUST optimize connector usage
- MUST monitor storage usage

#### Testing
- MUST conduct performance testing
- MUST establish performance baselines
- MUST monitor performance trends
- MUST document performance requirements

### 5. Experience Optimization Rules

#### UI/UX Standards
- MUST follow accessibility guidelines
- MUST implement responsive design
- MUST maintain consistent UI patterns
- MUST document UI/UX decisions

#### User Support
- MUST provide user documentation
- MUST implement help systems
- MUST collect user feedback
- MUST measure user satisfaction
