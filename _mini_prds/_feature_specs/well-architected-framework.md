# Power Platform Well-Architected Framework (WAF)

## Overview

The Power Platform Well-Architected Framework is a set of guiding principles and best practices designed to help organizations build and maintain high-quality Power Platform solutions. It is based on five core pillars, aligned with but adapted from the Azure Well-Architected Framework for Power Platform specific needs.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Reliability
- **Goal**: Ensure applications meet commitments and handle failures gracefully
- **Key Aspects**:
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Data backup and restoration
  - Business continuity planning
  - Scalability considerations
  - Environment management

### 2. Security
- **Goal**: Protect applications, data, and infrastructure from threats
- **Key Aspects**:
  - Identity and access management
  - Data protection and encryption
  - Network security
  - Security monitoring and auditing
  - Compliance requirements

### 3. Operational Excellence
- **Goal**: Streamline development, deployment, and maintenance processes
- **Key Aspects**:
  - Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)
  - Documentation standards
  - Monitoring and diagnostics
  - Automated deployment
  - Change management

### 4. Performance Efficiency
- **Goal**: Scale systems to meet demands while optimizing resource usage
- **Key Aspects**:
  - Data performance optimization
  - Query optimization
  - Resource utilization
  - Monitoring and metrics
  - Continuous performance optimization

### 5. Experience Optimization
- **Goal**: Ensure optimal user experience and adoption
- **Key Aspects**:
  - User interface design
  - Accessibility standards
  - Performance perception
  - User feedback integration
  - Training and support
