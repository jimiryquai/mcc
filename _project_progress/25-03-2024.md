# Project Progress Report - March 25, 2024

## Key Learnings
- WAF structure can be effectively scaled based on project size (S/M/L)
- Power Platform projects benefit from size-specific implementation guides
- Documentation organization benefits from clear navigation structure

## Key Achievements
- Established complete WAF directory structure with five pillars
- Implemented comprehensive project sizing framework (S/M/L)
- Created size-aware documentation templates
- Set up `.order` files for improved navigation
- Organized documentation hierarchy

## Key Challenges
- Initial directory structure creation required multiple attempts
- File organization needed careful consideration for scalability
- Balancing detail vs. flexibility in sizing recommendations

## Next Steps
### Immediate Actions
- Create agile ceremony recommendations for each project size
- Develop templates for WAF reviews in sprint ceremonies
- Create guidance for mapping WAF implementation to story points

### Upcoming Tasks
- Apply size-aware templates to remaining pillars
- Add specific implementation details for each size category
- Create decision trees for implementation choices
- Expand Power Platform specific guidance

### Documentation Tasks
- Detail environment strategy patterns
- Document ALM practices integration
- Complete remaining pillar templates

## Notes
- Foundation is solid for Power Platform agile projects
- Structure supports both small and large-scale implementations
- Framework allows for natural project evolution
