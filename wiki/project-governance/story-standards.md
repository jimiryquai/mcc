# User Story Standards and Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the standards for creating and managing user stories in our Azure DevOps environment. It ensures consistency and quality across all project work items.

## Story Format

```gherkin
As a [role/persona]
I want [capability/feature]
So that [benefit/value]
```

## Quality Guidelines
Each story should be:
- **Independent**: Can be delivered separately
- **Negotiable**: Room for discussion
- **Valuable**: Clear business or user value
- **Estimable**: Team can size it
- **Small**: Fits within a sprint
- **Testable**: Clear acceptance criteria

## Acceptance Criteria Requirements
Use Gherkin syntax:
```gherkin
Given [context/precondition]
When [action/event occurs]
Then [expected outcome]
```

## Story Classifications
Stories may be tagged with:
- `AT-RISK`: Indicates dependency on incomplete foundation elements
- `DECISION-REQUIRED`: Needs architectural/technical decision
- `FOUNDATION`: Related to core project infrastructure

## Linking Requirements
Stories must link to:
- Related risks (if AT-RISK)
- Related decisions (if implementing a decision)
- Parent features/epics
- Related documentation

## Example Story

```gherkin
Title: View Onboarding Progress

As a new employee
I want to see my onboarding progress
So that I know what steps I need to complete

Acceptance Criteria:

Scenario: View Progress Dashboard
Given I am logged into the onboarding portal
When I navigate to "My Progress"
Then I should see my completed and pending tasks
And each task should show its status and due date

Scenario: Mark Task Complete
Given I am viewing a pending task
When I complete the task requirements
Then the task should be marked as complete
And my overall progress should update
