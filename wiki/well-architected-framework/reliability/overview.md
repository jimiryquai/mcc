# Reliability Pillar Overview

## Introduction
The Reliability pillar focuses on ensuring our solutions meet commitments and handle failures gracefully. This includes implementing robust error handling, effective data management strategies, and comprehensive business continuity planning.

## Key Areas

### Error Handling Strategies
- Exception handling and logging
- Graceful degradation patterns
- User feedback mechanisms
- Retry policies for transient failures

### Data Management
- Data backup and recovery procedures
- Data integrity checks
- Version control and change tracking
- Data synchronization strategies

### Business Continuity Planning
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Service level agreements (SLAs)
- Failover and redundancy planning
- Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Error handling framework implemented
- [ ] Logging and monitoring setup
- [ ] Data backup procedures documented and tested

- [ ] SLAs defined and monitored
- [ ] Business continuity plan documented

## Metrics & KPIs
- System uptime percentage
- Error resolution time
- Data backup success rate
- Recovery time measurements
- SLA compliance rate

## Review Schedule
- Monthly review of error logs
- Quarterly backup testing
